# SOLARIS — ASSEMBLY STATE (see AGENT_BRIEF.md §10)

## NEXT ACTION
BLOCKED awaiting Lead ruling F9: canon 1B auto-run self-deadlock —
`publishSuite({ started: true })` immediately before `runSuite()` satisfies
runSuite's reentrancy guard (`started && !done`), so the suite never
executes and no verdict can ever log (diagnosis + proposal in
notes/reports/M1B.md §Step 4: delete the one pre-publish line). On
authorization: apply F9 to the extracted harness, re-run the 1B gate
(20 s) + 1A regression, complete notes/reports/M1B.md with verbatim gate
output, commit, push, STOP at the approval gate. Also pending (do not
block on): Lead's 1C-CP verdict addendum (F8) + the newly-found canon 1902
`seamless': {` missing-quote defect.

## MILESTONE LEDGER
| MS | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| scaffold | DONE | game/ tree committed (WIP d849d6b); deps pinned per §3.3 (react 18.2.0, three 0.165.0, R3F 8.18.0, zustand ^4.4, TS ~5.4, vite 5.4.21, playwright 1.64.0); `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` clean |
| 1A | APPROVED | Commit df1e04f "M1A: extracted, gates green"; gate GREEN 5/5 PASS, 9 rebases matching canon's predicted trace, zero canon edits; report: notes/reports/M1A.md |
| 1B | EXTRACTED · F7 APPLIED · GATE BLOCKED (canon deadlock) | 5/5 verbatim + overlay verified (1d302df); F7a/F7b applied per ruling, typecheck+build clean (d582efc); 1A regression PASSED on overlaid core; 1B gate deadlocked by canon auto-run guard → F9 requested (aca7047); report: notes/reports/M1B.md |
| 1C–1G | NOT STARTED | 1C additionally blocked on verdict-line decision (no PASSED token in canon — M1B.md §Step 0) |

## IN-FLIGHT
Milestone 1B / step 4 — gates run. 1A regression: PASSED 5/5 on the
overlaid core (overload is safe). 1B gate: deadlocked — canon auto-run
publishes `started:true` before runSuite(), whose reentrancy guard
(`started && !done`) then returns immediately; suite never executes; chip
stuck RUNNING, badges `·····`, no verdict possible. Diagnosis chain:
DOM probe (mount OK, RUNNING) → main-thread RESPONSIVE (not a hang) →
canon read of guard (1656) + auto-run (2226). Nothing tried beyond
diagnosis; F9 (delete the one pre-publish line) proposed and awaiting
authorization. Diagnostic tool: game/tools/diag-m1b.mjs (kept for reuse).

## APPROVAL LEDGER (settled — never re-ask)
| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| 2026-10-14 | Opening report approved in full (structure, pins, gates, branch strategy) |
| 2026-10-14 | §4 regex relaxation approved (exactly one parenthetical match: 1B SimulationCore) |
| 2026-10-14 | Ordered: branch m1-assembly, scaffold per §3, begin Milestone 1A |
| 2026-10-14 | Multi-session continuity protocol installed per Lead directive |
| 2026-10-14 | MILESTONE 1A: APPROVED (gate GREEN, 5/5 PASS, 9 rebases matching canon's predicted trace, zero canon edits) |
| 2026-10-14 | Protocol install ratified: §10 append, STATE.md structure, anchor fixed-point convention (anchor = stable work commit; carrier commit via `git log -1 --format=%H -- notes/STATE.md`), CHANGES.md relocation to root notes/ |
| 2026-10-14 | Pre-authorized fix F6 ratified (scope: ONLY each harness's acceptance-verdict console.log; insert missing `$`; FORBIDDEN: badge detail strings, HUD strings, CSS template literals; any other difference → STOP and paste exact extracted source; logged in AGENT_BRIEF.md §10.4) |
| 2026-10-14 | Commit & push policy amended (§8.8): commit after every §8 loop step + every §10.2 checkpoint + wind-down; push m1-assembly to origin PRE-AUTHORIZED after every commit; never push main, never force-push, never stage canon (logged in AGENT_BRIEF.md §10.4) |
| 2026-10-14 | 1B pre-scan ordered as step 0 of the next session: read-only grep of all seven Milestone .txt files for the acceptance console lines, reporting per file whether the `$` is present |
| 2026-10-14 | F7 RATIFIED: 1B defects are canon authorship errors; F7a/F7b applied to extracted harness (canon patched by the Lead); systemic pre-scan rule added (backtick+`{`, single-armed ternary → route, never F6-repair) |
| 2026-10-14 | F8 ISSUED: 1C verdict = canon truncation; Lead will author 1C-CP addendum; assembler supplies verbatim 1C harness tail; 1C gated until it lands |

## SESSION LOG
| # | Date | Goal | Outcome | Handoff note |
|---|------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 2026-10-14 | §9 opening report → scaffold + Milestone 1A | Opening report approved; branch m1-assembly created; game/ scaffolded per §3; extract.mjs written (6/6 blocks 1A); 1A wired, typecheck+build clean, gate PASSED 5/5; report delivered in chat — ended before writing the STATE.md/report files (protocol did not exist yet) | none written — reconciled post-hoc |
| 2 | 2026-10-14 | Protocol install + reconcile | AGENT_BRIEF.md written verbatim (389-line paste + 47-line §10 append); session-1 work preserved as WIP d849d6b; notes/ tree created; CHANGES.md relocated to root; STATE.md written from evidence; M1A report persisted to notes/reports/M1A.md | Session parked at the 1A approval gate — resumed by session 3 |
| 3 | 2026-10-14 | 1A approval + protocol install | approved + installed + pushed | Run the F6 pre-scan over all seven Milestone .txt files (report per file whether the acceptance-line `$` is present), then begin Milestone 1B: read Milestone/Milestone 1B.txt in full, run `node tools/extract.mjs 1B` (expect 5 blocks; the parenthetical overlay on src/core/simulation/SimulationCore.ts explicitly reported — it must be the ONLY parenthetical match), F6 check/repair on the 1B harness, register ?page=m1b, typecheck+build, run the 1B gate PLUS the 1A page as regression, write notes/reports/M1B.md with verbatim gate output and the pre-scan table, commit per the amended cadence, push, then STOP at the approval gate. |
| 4 | 2026-10-14 | M1B execution | (continuation — session resumed after wind-down in the same live session) | in progress — parked only at the 1B approval gate |

## ANCHOR
df1e04f — "M1A: extracted, gates green" (branch m1-assembly; chain: ea112ec
canon → d849d6b WIP preservation → 2e409c0 protocol install → df1e04f M1A
approval). This wind-down STATE.md travels in the commit AFTER df1e04f (a
file cannot contain its own commit hash); resolve the exact carrier with
`git log -1 --format=%H -- notes/STATE.md`. Canon (Design_specs/,
Milestone/) must remain unchanged from ea112ec — verified: git diff ea112ec
on both trees is empty.
